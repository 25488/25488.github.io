🔍 About My Cybersecurity Journey

I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, focusing on ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network security. I enjoy exploring how systems can be protected from real-world threats and understanding how attackers exploit vulnerabilities. My goal is to design secure applications and infrastructures by applying both offensive and defensive security principles.

🧰 Tools & Frameworks I Work With
⚙️ Recon-ng

A powerful reconnaissance framework I use for gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT) during the early stages of penetration testing.

Used for domain and subdomain enumeration

Gathers data from multiple public sources (e.g., Whois, Shodan, etc.)

Automates reconnaissance workflows

🧬 Scapy

A packet manipulation and analysis tool I use for network security testing and custom packet crafting.

Packet sniffing and injection

Network mapping and scanning

Simulating attacks to test defenses

🔎 Nmap

A versatile network scanner I use for host discovery, port scanning, and service/version detection.

Fast host discovery (ping sweeps, ARP)

Port scanning techniques (SYN scan, TCP connect, UDP scan)

Service and OS detection (version fingerprinting)

Helpful for building network inventories and attack surface analysis

🎭 Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

A framework I use to understand social engineering techniques and simulate real-world attack vectors safely.

Phishing and credential-harvesting simulations

Awareness training for social engineering defense

Supports ethical hacking and cybersecurity learning

🧠 Areas of Focus

Network Security Analysis

Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking)

Vulnerability Assessment

Social Engineering Defense

Incident Response Awareness

🧩 Current Learning Goals

Exploring Metasploit Framework for advanced exploitation testing

Learning Wireshark for deeper packet inspection

Studying Web Application Security (OWASP Top 10)
