# ðŸ§ª Lab Challenge â€” Spear Phishing Awareness Simulator (Spear Phishing)

**Goal:**  
Design and run a small, consented spearâ€‘phishing simulation for awareness training. The focus is on demonstrating how targeted socialâ€‘engineering works, measuring user interaction, and providing immediate remediation and learning resources. All data collected must be sanitized, minimal, and handled ethically.

---

## ðŸ”’ Safety & Ethics (must-read)
- **Written permission only.** Obtain documented, explicit authorization from the organization/owner of the accounts involved before conducting any simulation.
- **Scope & limits.** Define target accounts, allowed times, and an optâ€‘out process in a `rules_of_engagement.md`.
- **No real credentials.** Never store real credentials. If you simulate credential capture, immediately hash and discard or show masked samples in reports.
- **Transparent remediation.** Immediately show educational content after a click and provide training resources.
- **Sanitize screenshots.** Mask real names, emails, and IP addresses before publishing.

---

## ðŸ§° Required tools & tech
- Socialâ€‘Engineer Toolkit (SET) or manual email templates (lab-only).  
- A local SMTP server configured to **not** relay externally (e.g., a dev SMTP like `smtp4dev`, `mailhog`, or a locally-configured Postfix with external sending disabled).  
- Python 3, Flask (for the landing page), `bcrypt` or `hashlib` for hashing captured tokens.  
- SQLite or local JSON for ephemeral logging (optional).  
- Browser (for screenshots), and a sandbox VM for target test account(s).

---

## Lab setup (lab environment)
1. Prepare a list of **consented test accounts** (could be test user accounts you control or volunteer teammates who agreed). Save as `targets.csv`.
2. Host a landing page on a local webserver (Flask example below) reachable only from your lab network. Do **not** expose to the public internet.
3. Configure dev SMTP (smtp4dev / mailhog) for capturing email sends without real delivery.
4. Ensure all participants know a remediation and support contact (e.g., security@lab.local).

## Example spearâ€‘phishing email (sanitized)
> This is a **template** for lab use only â€” send only to consenting test accounts.

**Subject:** Action required: Update your lab account access

**From:** IT Support &lt;it-support@lab.local&gt;  
**To:** `consented_user@lab.local`

**HTML Body (sanitized):**
```html
